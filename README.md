Implementation of a table lamp.

The lamp stands on a plane, the structure (from bottom to top): cylinder base,
ball joint1, cylinder rod1, ball joint2, cylinder rod2,
ball joint3, paraboloid with a parabola at the focal point
point source of light.
Spherical joints are axes other than the coordinate axes
are continuously rotating along axes other than the axis of the axis of rotation. The actors are also represented by a
point light source and ambient light. The camera
rotates around the lamp.
The actors are of diffuse-specular type with a lumpy material.
